## Join the GOAT Team

For the first time since the creation of our tight nit community, it is being opened up to the public.  Donors will recieve 1 year of access to our Discord server.  Our community is a safe place for crypto.  We are anti-scammers, anti-pumpNdump, anti-fighting.  Here you will find quite a few veterans of the crypto scene, many of us having worked for or contributing to many crypto networks.

We are opening up 4 levels of membership for donors:
* Bronze   - $25
* Silver   - $50
* Gold     - $100
* Platinum - $250

As this community evolves, more benefits will be added to the community depending on your donor levels.

## What we use the donations for

* Hosting expenses
* More guides
* Future features
